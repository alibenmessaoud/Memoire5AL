# Abstract

The only way of this report is explantion of why continious integration must be used. To demonstrate that we will see in a first part why continous integration will be generalized into companies in few years. In fact we choose this subject because we believe that code quality is one of the most important thing in a project as well as because more and more compagny begins to use it successfully.

Continious integration is one of the best way to develop a quality software while saving money. When we talk about quality we mean create a software that exactly meets the customer's needs. This software must be also develop in time whitout any major bugs. 

We would see why continious intergration should this kind of problems because unlike we can trust, continious integration wasn't only a single tool. It is in fact many tools and some best practices mixed together. For example for the tools we will present unit tests. Unit tests are the basis for continuous integration.

To manage correctly your continous integration projet, we will see some Agiles methods like SCRUM but we will also see is it possible to mix it whit other agiles practice  like the test driven developpement who is certainly the best way to work when we use Continous integration.

On the last part we will discuss about technologies that will democratize in the years to come, like continous integration in the cloud
